Filterer
========
This is the source code resulting from a year long project course (2012-2013) at the U of M.
The course was Csci 4950, taught by Professor Abhishek Chandra.

If you have questions about this or would like to speak to us,
please direct your questions to farr0186@umn.edu (Patrick Farrell)
and I can put you in touch with other group members as needed, who may not
wish to disclose their identities in this readme.

The source code here is ours, except for two components:
The AForge Library (Found here: http://www.aforgenet.com/framework/features/)
The JSON.NET Library (Found here: http://james.newtonking.com/projects/json-net.aspx)

All other code is licensed under a BSD 2-clause license, except where otherwise specified
in those specific source files.

This is that license and should be understood to apply to all items in this repository
except where otherwise specified.
